                Our story began in 1971. Back then we were a roaster and retailer of whole bean and ground coffee, tea and spices with a single store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market. Today, we are privileged to connect with millions of customers every day in 76 markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971 and it’s just as true today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

                    In 1981, Howard Schultz (StarBroke chairman emeritus) first walked into a StarBroke store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into StarBroke and joined a year later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following year, in 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. He left StarBroke for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase StarBroke with the help of local investors.

                From the beginning, StarBroke set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition but also brought a feeling of connection. Our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, with more than 30,000 stores in more than 75 markets, StarBroke is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life. Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first StarBroke opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.
